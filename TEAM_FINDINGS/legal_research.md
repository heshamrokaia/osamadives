## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive research into Egyptian diving regulations, CDWS requirements, and tourism laws, there are **significant legal restrictions** on how individual diving instructors can market themselves in Egypt. The key finding is that **individual diving professionals are explicitly prohibited from marketing and selling diving services through personal websites or social media** under CDWS regulations and Egyptian Ministerial Decree No. 444 (2011).

## 1. Egyptian Diving Regulations (CDWS)

### What is CDWS?

The **Chamber of Diving and Water Sports (CDWS)** is the official regulatory body for diving in Egypt, established in 2007 by the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism. All diving operations in the Red Sea and South Sinai must comply with CDWS regulations.

- [CDWS Rules & Regulations](https://www.cdws.travel/rules-regulations)

### Key CDWS Requirements for Diving Professionals

1. **CDWS Professional ID Card Required**
   - All diving instructors must hold a valid CDWS Professional ID card
   - Must be certified by a CDWS-accredited training organization (PADI is accredited)
   - Insurance for diving accidents is mandatory for CDWS card issuance/renewal

2. **Certification Requirements**
   - Instructors must hold minimum 2-star certification (OWSI) or equivalent
   - Must carry original CDWS ID card while performing duties
   - Must use diving computers during work activities

3. **Technical Manager Requirements (for dive centers)**
   - Must hold instructor license (second level)
   - Must be at least 25 years old

## 2. Freelance Instructor Rules - CRITICAL FINDING

### The Core Prohibition

The CDWS Professional ID Card Agreement contains a **critical clause** that directly impacts Osama's ability to market independently:

> "I have no right to do marketing and advertising or sell any diving or water sports activities through social networking pages and/or websites."

This prohibition is backed by **Egyptian Ministerial Decree No. 444 (2011)** and its amendments.

### Dive Center Affiliation Requirement

The agreement also states:

> "I will not practice the profession of training or guidance unless after renewing the license of the training organization to which I am affiliated."

**Key Implications:**
- Individual instructors **cannot** operate independently
- Marketing rights are **exclusively reserved** for licensed tourism establishments (dive centers)
- Card holders must work through their member center or safari boat employer
- Selling diving activities directly to tourists via personal websites is **prohibited**

### Foreign vs Egyptian Instructors

While much of the discussion around work permits applies to **foreign instructors**, the marketing prohibition applies to **all** CDWS card holders, including Egyptian nationals.

**For foreign instructors:**
- Work permit required (costs approximately 3,000 EGP + medical tests ~100 EUR)
- Must be sponsored by a dive center
- 3:10 ratio (3 foreign workers per 10 Egyptian employees with social insurance)

**For Egyptian instructors (like Osama):**
- No work permit required (Egyptian national)
- Still must hold CDWS Professional ID card
- Still subject to CDWS marketing restrictions
- Must be affiliated with a licensed dive center for professional activities

## 3. Website/Marketing Legality

### Direct Marketing Prohibition

Based on the CDWS Professional ID Card Agreement, individual diving professionals are **explicitly prohibited** from:

- Marketing diving services through personal websites
- Advertising diving activities on social media
- Selling diving courses or activities directly to tourists
- Operating any form of direct booking system for diving services

### What IS Allowed

The regulations focus on **selling and marketing diving services**. The following activities appear to be permissible:

1. **Personal branding/portfolio websites** - Showcasing credentials and experience
2. **Educational content** - Blog posts about diving, Dahab, marine life
3. **Social media presence** - Personal posts, diving photography, lifestyle content
4. **Referrals to dive centers** - Directing interested clients to affiliated dive center

### Pricing Display

The user mentioned that pricing cannot be displayed on websites. This aligns with the CDWS prohibition on **selling** diving activities through personal websites. If you cannot sell services, displaying prices would imply you are selling, which violates the regulations.

### Egyptian Advertising Law

Egypt's **Law No. 206 of 2017** governs advertising of products and services. Key requirements:

- All advertising claims must be accurate and substantiated
- Content must not mislead consumers
- Online advertising follows same rules as traditional media
- Sponsored content must be clearly labeled
