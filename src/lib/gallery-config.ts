    story: 'This photograph is one of my most treasured possessions. Dated August 17, 1987 - just four years after my family arrived in Dahab from Cairo. We were the fourth family to settle here, in a village with no electricity, no phones, and only dirt roads leading to the sea. That truck you see? It was one of the few vehicles that could make the journey from the mainland. Behind us, early Dahab - just a handful of buildings, some Bedouin camps, and endless possibilities. My father had a vision: that this tiny fishing village where the desert meets the Red Sea would become something special. He opened Shark Restaurant, and we began welcoming travelers from around the world to our table. Forty years later, that same hospitality continues - first on land at our restaurant, now underwater as I guide visitors through the reefs I have known since childhood. When people ask me why I love Dahab so much, I show them this photo. This is not just where I work - this is my home, my heritage, my entire life.'

Before any dive, you sit down in a Bedouin-style cafe right on the beach, drink tea or fresh juice, fill out the paperwork, and talk about what you are going to see below. You see that Keesiedive shirt? That is a Dutch dive outfit - we had divers from all over coming through. The girl waving in the back, the boy doing his logbook - everyone relaxed, no rush. That is Dahab diving. It is not factory-style tourism. You take your time, you settle in, and then you go explore. The blue truck behind us would take us to the dive site. Some of my best memories are from these moments before the dive even starts.'

I always tell the parents: your child will never forget this day. And they never do. Some of these kids I taught years ago are now certified divers who come back to Dahab with their own friends. That is the most beautiful thing about teaching - you plant a seed and years later it grows into a lifelong love for the sea.'

The contrast is extraordinary: burning desert above, cool blue paradise below. I have been leading these safaris for years, and each time I am reminded that Dahab is not just about diving - it is about the intersection of two worlds, the desert and the sea, tradition and adventure. When you surface after the dive and see camels waiting on the shore, you understand that you are experiencing something truly unique.'

A fan coral this large could be a hundred years old or more, growing slowly in the current, filtering food from the water day after day. I always bring my divers to this spot and tell them to just hover and look. You can see the intricate pattern of every branch, like lace made by the sea itself. When the current is right, the coral opens up fully and it is like a living curtain between you and the blue. This is the kind of thing you cannot see in any aquarium. You have to come here, to this reef, and see it in person.'

He came to Dahab in 2005 for that record attempt, and our friendship goes back to those days. When the best deep divers in the world come to Dahab, they come through here. Nuno is not just a record holder - he is one of the most humble people you will ever meet. A civil engineer from South Africa, born in Portugal, who just loved going deeper. He always says he never planned to break records, he just kept diving a little deeper each time. That is the spirit of a true diver.'

    story: 'This is my close friend Nuno Gomes, and we are sitting right here in my restaurant - Shark Restaurant in Dahab. Nuno is one of the greatest deep divers who ever lived. In 1996, he set the Guinness World Record for the deepest cave dive at 283 meters in Boesmansgat, South Africa. Then in June 2005, he came right here to Dahab and broke the world record for the deepest seawater scuba dive - 318.25 meters in the Red Sea. It took him only 20 minutes to go down, but 12 hours to come back to the surface. Imagine that - 12 hours of decompression. The man is a civil engineer from South Africa, born in Portugal, and he is as humble as they come. He once said "I never thought about records, I just kept on diving a bit deeper." That is the kind of person he is. When you sit with Nuno, you would never guess he descended deeper than almost any human being on the planet. He did it right here, in our waters, in Dahab. And now here we are sharing a shrimp dinner at my place like two old friends. This is what diving does - it connects people across the world.'

    story: 'This is the shot from the other angle - you can see Kuba reaching down to set the card on the coral, the ring box next to it. The third diver on the right is our photographer, making sure we captured everything. The whole dive was planned down to the minute. I led the group to this exact spot on the reef because the coral here forms a natural shelf. Kuba knew the signal - when I tapped my tank three times, that was his cue. He reached into his BCD pocket, pulled out the card and the ring, and placed them right there. Kasia swam up behind him, not knowing what was about to happen. I have guided thousands of dives in this reef, but this one I will remember until my last breath.'
